# Welcome to The CupCaitery Codebase!

Hey Claude! You're working on a super fun bakery website. Here's the scoop:

## The Vibe

This isn't your boring corporate site - it's a **joyful, colorful, Lisa Frank-inspired** celebration of custom baked goods! Think:

- Bright pinks, purples, teals, and yellows
- Animated sprinkles floating around
- Bouncy logo animations
- Cards that wiggle and tilt
- Pure sugary happiness

## The Stack

Super simple - just HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of vanilla JS:

- `index.html` - Everything lives here (single-page site)
- `styles.css` - Where the colorful magic happens
- `images/logo.svg` - The adorable cupcake logo with the pink bow

## Color Palette

```css
--mint: #a8e8e0        /* Background - like mint frosting */
--pink: #ff6b9d        /* Primary accent - sweet and bold */
--purple: #b196d6      /* Secondary - like lavender icing */
--teal: #55d0b6        /* Accent - fresh and fun */
--yellow: #ffd93d      /* Pop of sunshine */
--brown: #5c4033       /* Text - like chocolate */
```

## Important Notes

- The logo is an SVG so it stays crisp at any size
- Sprinkles are generated with JavaScript and float around
- Cards have playful hover effects (tilt left/right)
- Everything is mobile responsive
- Fonts: Grandstander (headings) + Quicksand (body)

## The Business

Caite is a certified pastry chef who bakes under Kentucky Home Baker laws. She makes:
- Custom sugar cookies (her specialty!)
- Logo cookies for businesses
- Cakes, cupcakes, and cake pops
- Even custom 3D-printed cookie cutters!

## Keep It Fun!

When making changes, remember: this site should make people smile and crave cupcakes. More sprinkles, more color, more joy!
